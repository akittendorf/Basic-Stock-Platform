# USA Domestic Stock Market Analysis 
## PURPOSE:
This is a basic stock market analysis tool created as a capstone project for Dev10. The purpose of this project is to analyze the domestic stock market and its top 5 sectors as determined by market capitalization. Vanguard's top 5 ETF index funds were chosen to represent the top 5 sectors in the US. Vanguard's VTI was chosen as the index fund used to represent the US economy. We compare the historical stock prices of VTI to the total US revenue by year for the years 2006-2020 to validate the latter assumption. Several machine learning models were implemented to see if Vanguard's top 5 ETF index funds were valid indicators of economic trends in the US. This was done by using other US economic features as training and testing data. 

## REQUIREMENTS:
This project utilizes Azure Databricks, Microsoft Azure Data Factories and Pipelines, Kafka Producers and Consumers, SQL databases, and Power BI.

## MAINTENANCE:
This was created for an assignment and will likely not be updated after 2/18/2022.
